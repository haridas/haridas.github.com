Why Recessions directly affecting IT industries first
=====================================================

Desclaimer - I'm dont have much experience to discus more deep connections of
financial models. I'm trying to explain things from my current experience and 
observations. Please correct me if I was wrong.

I got my B-Tech degree in Computer sciecne from N S S College of Engineering,
Palakkad, Kerala, India. Towards the end of the course every one trying to get jobs from the big
companies like TCS, Infosys etc. -- the initial offers were good compared to
the market potential.

For a long while I had a doubt why technical courses not getting that much
traction in terms of Jobs compared to the Business coursers. I figure it out
through experience only, the world of selling and buying culter. In order to
succeed on it we need good management on what we are dealing with.

The right deceisions only comes to our mind when you have deep knowledge in the
domain you are being working.

We can also relate this blog to why market currently requires more IT peoples
than any others.
