My pelican based blog. It was migrated from my old Wordpress blog.


Blog Structure
--------------

I put all the html files in root folder of the project itself. It was actually
generated by Pelican. You can see the settings file ``pelican.conf.py`` and
the ``Makefile`` under the main project directory to get an idea of 
pelican blog settings.

And the actual blog posts are under **src/** in Restructured Text Format.
So after adding new contents under **src/** just type bellow command to 
generate the html contents corresponding to the Restructured Text. 

You can change default theme to new one. There is a Pelican `Themes`_ project in
github, you can give a try.

.. code-blok: console
    make html



.. _pelican.conf.py:
https://github.com/haridas/haridas.github.com/blob/master/pelican.conf.py

.. _Makefile:
https://github.com/haridas/haridas.github.com/blob/master/Makefile

.. _Themes: https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican-themes
