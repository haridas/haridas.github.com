Hello Everyone,  I'm Haridas, a Software Engineer from India. I'm passionate
about how technology can solve problems in real-life and accelerate the
accessibility to basic needs for everyone.

This is my personal blog, I started this when I was in my first job to write
about my learnings and ideas that I have been working with. Blog entries aren't
that frequent,  mainly focusing on bringing unique and interesting content from
my journey.  

Personally, I follow most of the topics, mainly interested in Science,
Technology, and Social Science, outside work I spend time with family and also
explore the countryside.
