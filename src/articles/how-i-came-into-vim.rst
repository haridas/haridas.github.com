:title: How I came in to Vim

I know most of them in the programming world are very fascinated to Vim editor 
rather than typical IDE's like Eclipse, Visual Studios etc. Every one using Vim
has a story to tell, How they came in to Vim. Here is my story.

I was started to use the Vim editor from my College time onwards. Since then for
a long time I was just used it whenever there is no  other option available, and
I did't realized the importance of Vim editor.

After I started my Job as Server Administrator, I have to use Vim regularly to
work with servers and other configuration files. But I used it because there is
no other thing available at remote severs :). And some times when I watching
hackers video, most of them are using Vim editor to show their works,
I always wonder why they are using it instead of common IDE's. In the same time
I have an interest in Programming, so I tried to  automate my  works using 
different Scripting and Programming languages, that eventually turned me to a Programmer. 

When I was started to working as a Django developer I used to work with Eclipse with
python binding. At these times I very rarely used the Vim editor, most of time
I was engaged in Eclipse editor. Then I moved to another company as
a Python and Django backend developer, there I met `@Satyajit Ranjeev`_ My Team
Lead and a Big fan of Vim, He already using Vim as his main editor and he encouraged me and others to use
the Vim editor. But for few weeks I didn't mind it, and was worked with eclipse
itself. 

Finally one day evening I realized the fact that why the Vim gets this much interest
among programmers and other hackers. That was a sudden move, with in that day
Itself I learned the basic navigation key bindings and `@Satyajit Ranjeev`_ helped
me to setup the Vim as a general IDE for all my works. After that we together
working and learning to improve the Vim skills every day and I'm enjoying the
facts that I'm using it for my project works right after the first day of my
basic learning. When I look back I can see that I missed the Vim editor
for long time. Any way right now I became a big fan of Vim :). I used Vim to
type this blog entry.


The main facts that I liked with the Vim editors while comparing with other
editors are,

Basic Navigation
----------------

Actually this feature is the one which brought me to Vim. There is no need to
use Mouse, We can do every thing using key board. The mouse usage is far less
productive and more stressful if we compare the same operation with keyboard.
Mouse has an importance when user has no or very less idea about the GUI, then
He/She can do better with mouse. But that case is valid for short term usage
only.

If you are comfortable with touch typing then it's very easy to catch the Vim commands. 
This includes, navigating through,

* Files

* Pages

* Lines

* Words

* Characters 

And do all **CRUD** operations very quickly by using simple keystroke.

You might think that, we can do that with the keyboard arrow keys, that is
possible, but vim has its own way to do it. It got different modes of
working, **Insert Mode** - For typing contents, **Command mode** - In this mode we use
different shortcuts to do lot of operations, **Search Mode**, etc.

Using Vim is far faster and easy to work with any text editing
operations.Programmers are always doing it.

Availability
------------

By default all Gnu/Linux ship with the Vim editor. So we don't need to move to
other editors when you are working with Gnu/Linux. Mac and Windows also got Vim
editors so just download it and give a try. 
Also you can integrate the Vim key bindings with all major IDE's like
`Eclipse`_, `Visual Studio`_, etc..

Also the vim keyboard bindings for navigation are also being used with web
browsers(`Chrome`_, `Firefox`_), and even you can use this key bindings with 
OS command prompt.


Light weight, Fast and highly configurable
------------------------------------------

Even after adding lot of extensions with default Vim to make it general IDE
like look and feel, its size would be very less compared to other IDE's.And we
can customize the Vim editor very easily using its configuration file **.vimrc**
under the user home directory. And of course Vim is very fast.



One problem with Vim is, the learning curve. It has got lot of very advanced shortcuts
and key bindings that can  be understood after using it for a while,But the 
basic shortcuts required to get start with Vim is very simple. 
We will learn new and new keyboard bindings through out the life span :).

You can have a look at this `Article`_ which describes how the Vim key bindings
became integral part of our life ;).

My Vim Story-2 blog entry will come soon which describe the details how to
setup the Vim to make it suitable for all type of programmers.

Till then... Bye :)
