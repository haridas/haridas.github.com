When I was started to learn C programming language, I only know the term
Programming. After some time I learned basics of the Javascript and perl for
some internal projects, from there onwards I started to use the two
terms Scripting and Programming. I found some books of Javascript and
Perl describing about this at the beginning. But most of them are
not clearly specifying the difference correctly.

I think these terms were came  due to the difference of how these codes
are being running under the machine, ie; codes running under Interpreter
were normally called as Scripts and in Compilers were called as
Programs.The codes written in scripting languages are very simple to
understand compared to compiled languages like C/C++ or Java. 

We are using these languages to solve or implement all types of problems. There we
need to give importance to the problems and how well we can solve it using an 
efficient algorithm, It also counts the speed of the language, memory
usage, etc. The important is the `Algorithm`, if it is an optimal algorithm
then you can select any language that you like. Currently all major
Scripting languages like `Python, Perl ,Ruby` and `Tcl/Tk` are being
used for general purposes along with famous programming languages like
`C/C++` and `Java`.Other scripting languages are `Php` (Web
based applications ), `Lua Script` (Embedded language , very fast,low
memory foot print).

Conclusion
----------

You can call different Computer Languages as Scripting language or
Programming language, but remember that the Scripting language can do any
thing that a programming language could accomplish. And after all we have to be
more rational while picking good tool set to solve our problem.
