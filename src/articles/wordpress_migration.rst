Wordpress blog migrated to Pelican
==================================
:tags: wordpress,pelican,python
:category: blog

This blog was initialy a wordpress blog. As you know the reasons for
that. Wordpress is the most successful and feature rich blogging engine. So
I chose it without any doubt. I didn't even search for a python alternative blog
engine at that time. But after a while I felt the dificulties like adding some
changes to the wordpress code, bugs with the wordpress plugins and more
importantly the Web UI to type the blog bost very annoying.

If we are thinking the technical points, wordpress is a dynamic engine, it is
over killing for blogs and other wiki based sites. Main issue is the response.
The static pages are way faster compared to the dynamic contents. I know
wordpress has caching plugins to make the static pages out of dynamic one but
that is not a very relaiable solution.

Actually above points are all come to my mind after seeing the static site
generators and their awesome featues and flexibility. 

Advantages of static site generators over wordpress 
---------------------------------------------------

1. We are serving html directly so very fast.

2. Easy maintanence of the site, very less pain with setup DB and other things.

3. Use your faviourae text editors for blog posting. I use VIM.

4. It support markdown syntax (Markdown,ResT) - so we just need to type 
   the blogs in normal text with simple formating. So don't worry about the
   format(UI) of the blog while typing your post.

5. Host it on Github,  and very easy version control and site backup.

6. Very easy to customize the Themes  or other internals if you want.
