= Run spacy jobs on spark using pyspark


== spacy multi-processing cababilities

This feature included with spacy to speed up the pipeline processing
and making use of multiple core available on the machine.

But this feature not be a good candidate for execute with spark environment.


== Spark cluster configuration for spacy


1. worker - 1 with 1 cpu core, and 5 gb or so ram.
2. executor - 1, uses full resources of worker.
3. Spacy pipeline with multi-processing support.

Even if we don't enable `nlp.pipe` api, after first document processing, the nlp object goes into multip processing mode, it may be a bug on the spacy side; I couldn't find any option to disable the multi processing option on spacy. Because of this we have to take care at the spark side to avoid running multiple executor
per node and ensure the executor won't use more
than one cpu core to avoid spark side optimization
by spwaning more threads if cores are available for executor.

== Run spark with below configuration

=== master

```bash
./sbin/start-master
```

=== slave 1
```bash
./sbin/start-slave.sh -c 1 -m 5g spark://<master-hostname>:7077
```

IMPORTANT: Here we are setting spark worker to use only one CPU, this
means spark can launch one executor with 1 CPU, as with spacy workload
main computation happening at python side, and spacy brings the multiprocessing 
outside the spark framework.
