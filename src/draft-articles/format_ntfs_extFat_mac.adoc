Mac support for the NTFS filesystem isn't that great, 
and mac native apps doesn't support the NTFS disks ( eg; Photo app ).

I want to backup my original RAW photos shot from `SONY A6000` camera
into a disk, as i'm using Photos app to manage the images, it would be nice
if I can export the Photos library directly from the external HDD. Photos 
app does support this option, only problem was it requires compatible
file system. So I picked the `ExtFAT` as this one is more supported across the
different Operating systems.


Lets see How we can


```bash

fdisk -l

diskformat command doesn't have option format

```
