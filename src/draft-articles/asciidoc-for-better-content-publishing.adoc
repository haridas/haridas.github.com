When I started this blog using the pelican, I was extensively using the RestText
to write the blogs using Text editors like vim. This year I came to know that
we got another text formatting language called asciidoc. Which seems very promising
compared to others like rest and md file. Asciidoc comes with lot of features
and extensibility and tooling support to make the content to generated to html, pdf
or LatEX formats. The rich formatting language is simpler compares to the rest formatting,
and we can use the asciidoc to write books, as it provides all required constructs
required to do all levels of writing.

Here I'm explaining how I used the asciidoc with my blog and introducing tooling around
the ascidoc fomats.
