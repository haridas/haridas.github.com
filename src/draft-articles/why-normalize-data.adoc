This is pretty basic question all asks who are working in machine learning problems.
We need to properly understand the intutition behind it, Here i'm trying to explain 
why we need to normalize the data set before training the machine learning models.

All know that machine learning models are does nuemerical optimization to maximize
the likelyhood function for the given set of data set. So the calculation around
this is involves numbers only, and models doesn't care the unit of the data, only the
maginitude of the data.
