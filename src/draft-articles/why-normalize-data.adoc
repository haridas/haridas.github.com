Desclaimer:- These are my intutitions around this topic, some are I learned, and
some are my thoughts on the same topic. If something isn't inline with the expectation
please sent me a note.

This is pretty basic question all asks who are working in machine learning problems.
We need to properly understand the intutition behind it, Here i'm trying to explain 
why we need to normalize the data set before training the machine learning models.

All know that machine learning models are does nuemerical optimization to maximize
the likelyhood function for the given set of data set. So the calculation around
this is involves numbers only, and models doesn't care the unit of the data, only the
maginitude of the data.

Most of the objective functions are revolve around the probabilistic modeling, and the
central limit theory says with enough number of sample size most of the data samples
tend towards the normal distribution. The numerical optimiation frameworks used in
mathematics relay on this ( for best case scenario ).

Information theory based entropy function is being used as a standard objective function
in deep learning problems. Bringing all the maginitude betweens 0-1 is pretty 
common with this scnario to measure things in probabilistic terms.


New notes - 11-Jan-2019

1. Min-max vs z-score
2. Comparing probability distributions
3. Distribution with fixed min max like images 0-255 case min-max is good option.
4. Box-cox normalizer ie; IRQ normalizer.
5. Use of batch normalization helps to further deepen the DL networks without 
   any the overfitting issues.
6. Regression problems vs classification problems
7. Data types - how it veries can decide how we can normalize the sample.

Based on the objective function and the output distribution that we are dealing,
we can make use of the normaliztion.
