            <p>To follow this article the reader should at least have a basic idea of how to use
Vim and its command modes. Or if you are new to Vim, you can <a class="reference external" href="https://haridas.in/how-i-came-in-to-vim.html">read</a> my first blog to
know how I came in to Vim and its fundamental differences with other editors.</p>
<p>Here I'm trying to explain how to make the Vim more productive by adding some extra
features through Vim plugins. After this setup the Vim would have most of the
features that a modern IDE offers. I'm a python developer so this Vim setup
is a little inclined to python side. But I'm including general plugins
only to make it suitable for most of the programming languages.</p>
<p>The installation and configuration setups are being described at the end,
if you want to take a look at it, go here <a class="reference internal" href="#setup-vim-from-scratch">Setup Vim from Scratch</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update on Dec-18-2017</p>
<p>The plugin and vim environment got new changes. I captured it
on a separate blog (<a class="reference external" href="https://haridas.in/vim-upgrade-2017.html">https://haridas.in/vim-upgrade-2017.html</a>).
Please follow new blog entry now on.</p>
<p>Support for vim environment specified in this blog entry is deprecated now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic Vim or Vi installation comes with most of the Gnu/Linux machines are
more than enough for good productive works. And Vim has plugin structure, so we
can extend the Vim through plugins. The plugins further improve the productivity and
reduces lot of key strokes.</p>
<p>The Gnu/Linux's Console or Terminal based Vim has some limitation to show good
fonts and colors. So you have to install GTK version of the Vim(Gvim). Gvim gives
you all the good looking features to your Vim. Just take a look
at my Konsole and GTK Vim screen shots.</p>

<h2>Gvim</h2>
<img alt="Gvim image" class="align-left" src="/images/gvim.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" />
<p>Here is the list of plugins that I have been configured on my Vim.
It includes good color theme also. All of this Vim setup are there
on my Github project. Towards the end I described how to make use of my Github project to
get all of this features on your Vim. Before that first understand the
functionalities and use case of different plugins and then we can go to the
installation step.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE (16/June/2013):-</p>
<p>After using GVIM for a while, I came back to the Konsole itself since it's
more convenient for me. But one problem with terminal is that it only
support only 256 colors. But don't need to worry actually it's more than
enough. On the command mode of the vim run this command to enable 256
colors - &quot;:set t_Co=256&quot;. Actually this special setting is not required for
the default themes, but if we are using new themes with more colors and
font settings then those themes may not work properly on the terminal mode.
So this settings will make sure that it will work even though it will
degrade the features gracefully. My .vimrc has been updated with these
changes so you will get it from github.</p>

<p>A Side Note</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my .vimrc file, I disabled the use of arrow keys in the Vim command mode.
That was forced me to learn the Vim classic <strong>hjkl</strong> arrow keys, it really
worked for me. Now I don't required the key board arrow keys any more
even in Vim editing mode.</p>
<p>If you want to change this behaviour, just remove below sections from my
.vimrc file.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/vimrc1.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Similarly, you can just go through my .vimrc file to see other options,
I tried to document my .vimrc file as much as possible. You can play
around with it to make it suitable for you.</p>

<div class="section" id="minibuferexplorer-file-tabs">
<span id="minibuferexplorer"></span><h2>1. MinibuferExplorer (File Tabs)</h2>
<p>This is like Tabs on other IDE's. We can see the opened files on vim using this
plugin. By default, we have to use <cite>:ls</cite> to see opened buffers. So this
plugin makes it very convenient to view the opened files as a tabs.</p>
<p>Vim has slightly different concept about the Tabs compared to other IDE's.
Vim has support for tabs by default. That tab is different from the normal
IDE's Tab. Actually the difference is that the vim tabs are
a collection of opened buffers(or files.). So we can consider it as a group of
tabs in other IDE context.</p>
<p>But most of the time we only requires one vim tab and set of opened
buffers(files.). The MinibuferExplorar will help you to see those opened buffers as
a virtual tabs. See the screen shot below.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/minibufexplorer.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: 356px;" />
<p>You can use <cite>CTRL + h/j/k/l</cite> or <cite>CTRL + w</cite> to navigate around the different
split windows and the mini buffer Explorer. To open
a hidden buffer on a vertical split window, just go to the MinibuferExplorer and
pick a file buffer(You can use normal <cite>hj</cite> keys to move horizontally on
MiniBufferExplorer) then press <cite>v</cite>. Or Press <cite>s</cite> to open the
buffer or file on a horizontal split window.</p>

<div class="section" id="command-t-file-search">
<span id="command-t"></span><h2>2. Command-t (File Search)</h2>
<p>Very awesome plugin for Vim. Which help us to search files very quickly.
To get better speed it was implemented in C. To install this plugin
you need one extra compilation of this plugin because of C code. Don't worry
I explained this in the setup section.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/command-t.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Once we have enabled this plugin you can see the search list using your
<cite>&lt;leader&gt; + t</cite>. I'm using my leader key as <strong>,</strong> (Comma), so for me the
command will looks like <cite>,t</cite> (comma + t). Normally the leader key is &quot;\&quot; on
your default Vim comes with your Distro. You can change this setting in .vimrc
file.</p>
<p>Actually the leader key provides a extension to use all the keys in the
keyboard as your own shortcuts. This leader key is activated in the normal mode of the
vim.</p>
<p>Command-t only list all opened buffers by typing <cite>,b</cite> in normal mode. It's very
useful if we opened lot of files on your Vim.</p>

<div class="section" id="syntastic-syntax-checker">
<span id="syntastic"></span><h2>3. Syntastic (Syntax Checker)</h2>
<p>Another very useful plugin for all programming languages.
This plugin will help you to keep the syntax of a program correct --
like auto correct in other IDE's. This package is a general one so
we can expand it very easily by support for new languages. By default it
supports lot of programming languages. So this plugin is a must one for Vim.</p>
<p>For example, if you are editing a RST file (All my blog posts are in
reStructured Text format) and you made some syntax errors in it and then you saved
it, after the save operation the Syntastic Plugin will check for any syntax
errors on your file automatically and show you the location of the error and
its reason very neatly.</p>
<p>Take a look at a portion of the rst file of this blog post. I made a syntax
error in the image tag,</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/syntastic.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Similarly Synstastic will help you to follow the standard coding methods defined by
different programming communities. For eg; Python code has <strong>PEP8</strong> standard, so while
writing the python code, if we are not following it, Synstastic will show you the
errors. After a while you would learn the PEP8 standard without any extra work :).</p>

<div class="section" id="snipmate-code-templates">
<span id="snipmate"></span><h2>4. Snipmate (Code Templates)</h2>
<p>A simple way to avoid typing some repetitive sequence of codes. For example, in
python, we initialize a class by typing <cite>class</cite> keyword, name, etc... Instead
of doing all those drama, we can just populate the default set of class
structure from snipmate by typing <strong>cl</strong> &lt;tab&gt;. Try out it by opening a python
test file.</p>
<p>The Snimpate plugin provide a lot of such shortcuts for different programming
languages. We can also define our own snippets. For web developers it would be
very easy if we have snippets for &lt;table&gt;, &lt;div&gt; tag completions. By default
Snipmate does have support for different html tags. Please check
the snippets folder(<cite>~/.vim/bundle/snippets/</cite>) to see all available
snippets for a particular language or markup.</p>
<p>More examples;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vim test.py
</pre></div>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/python</span>
<span class="n">cl</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After typing <cite>cl</cite> press tab and see the magic of full class structure.
Similarly you can define your own snippets. For eg;
<cite>for</cite> &lt;tab&gt; to expand the <cite>for</cite> statement of your language.</p>

<p>This plugin is for git repository management inside Vim itself. It provides set
of short commands, that we can directly use in the Vim command mode to see and do the
git related operations. We don't need to go outside the editing environment to
manage those stuffs.</p>
<p>Also it have very nice git diff view inside vim itself, it is very nice
to use.</p>
<p>To see all available git commands under this plugin just type

lot of shortcuts to navigate through the source tree easily. It is an another
common Plugin required for an IDE. Check the below image to see how it looks
like.</p>
<p>Shortcuts - I mapped the following keys in .vimrc file to show and hide the
Nerdtree when ever required. You can re-map this to your own choice.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/nerd_tree.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>To open and close the Nerdtree press <strong>CTRL + n</strong>. Also you can see other

<div class="section" id="nerdcommenter-commenting">
<span id="nerdcommenter"></span><h2>7. NerdCommenter (Commenting)</h2>
<p>This plugin is only to comment out multi line code blocks together. In normal
vim there is no such thing(<a class="reference internal" href="#update">Update</a>), so if we want to comment multiple lines
we have to go through each lines.</p>
<p>This plugin makes it handy, so you only need to select the code block using
mouse or keyboard (Vim visual mode) and type the following commands to comment
it out or uncomment.</p>
<p>Comment entire selected code block : <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;leader&gt;cc,</tt></p>
<p>Toggle the commented state : <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;leader&gt;c&lt;space&gt;</tt></p>
<p><span class="target" id="update">Update</span>: Please see the comments of this post, there is a way to comment out
multiple lines in the default Vim itself, But it's not a programming language

<div class="section" id="id1">
<span id="rope"></span><h2>8. Rope</h2>
<p>Rope is a special Plugin for Python project navigation. Most of the IDE's have
similar feature to see the definition of a function or class by clicking on it or
via some shortcut keys.</p>
<p>By default, if we open a Python project in Vim it won't have support for this
feature. When we trying to use this feature first time, the Rope will prompt
you to create a Ropeproject under current directory. And keep the
configurations specific to Rope Project in <strong>./.ropeproject</strong> folder under
current directory.</p>
<p>The Plugin helps us to create the settings easily, after that we can use this plugin to
view definition of all functions or classes comes under the rope project path.</p>
<p>In my Vim I mapped the <strong>&lt;leader&gt;j</strong> to :RopeGotoDefinition. For eg.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Keep your cursor on top of the <cite>os</cite> and press the &lt;leader&gt;j or type
:RopeGotoDefinition, Vim will take you into the os file from the system path
Similarly we can go to definitions of any python entity comes under the Rope
path settings. You can update the Rope settings for this python project from
<strong>./.ropeproject/config.py</strong> file.</p>
<p>This plugin also required for the modern IDE feature list. :)</p>

<p>This section is to discus about already existing awesome features build in
with the Vim. You can consider me as a beginner in this area :).
If you are looking for learning more advanced details of the Vim editor,
you don't need to search on google, you can find it out under its documentation
itself.</p>
<p>To see all documentation type <cite>ESC + :help</cite>. The documentation is very
huge, so Vim provides search option across all its documentation. To see
a documentation about a topic, type <cite>ESC + :help &lt;topic&gt;</cite></p>
<p>For eg;</p>
<p>To see about the documentation of <em>jumps</em> , type : <cite>ESC + :help jumps</cite></p>
<p>I wrote above example, because it is an another interesting feature required
for modern IDE. The thing is that it was already build in with Vim.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Jump List</strong></p>
<p>I found this feature accidentally. It is to jump across different files and
the same time it have an option for jump back through all the files that we
came across.</p>
<p>To understand this feature - If we used Rope plugin to see definition of
a function outside the current file, it will open a new buffer in Vim and
it take you to that file. What if we want to come back to the same location of
previous file ?. This requires jump back operation. Press <cite>CTRL + o</cite>, you can
see the magic. Press <cite>CTRL + &lt;tab&gt;</cite> to go forward again.</p>
<p>There is much more things are there about jumplist, Vim internally keeps the
list of our locations across different files. you can see that by typing
<cite>:jumps</cite>. Different instances of the Vim will share the same jump list.</p>
<p>Similar to this, lot of things are out there to learn. This Others section
is not going to end here :). But for now I'm stopping here.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the explanation of Vim feature is over now, lets take a look at how to setup
the Vim to get all these above features and make Vim ready to extend with new
plugins.</p>
<p>Back to <a class="reference internal" href="#topics">Topics</a></p>
<div class="section" id="setup-vim-from-scratch">
<h3>Setup Vim from Scratch</h3>
<p>All required packages are there in my Vim <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/haridas/Dotfiles/tree/master/vim-files">github</a> project. I put all those
settings and plugins in standard way. So you can extend or remove them when
ever required.</p>
<p>Before doing this, please take a backup of your current Vim settings from your home
directory.</p>
<p>We can start the installation by picking my Git Repository,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span>git clone git://github.com/haridas/Dotfiles.git

<span class="gp">$</span><span class="nb">cd</span> Dotfiles
</pre></div>
<p>I kept all the required plugins as git submodules. So we will get the new
changes from the plugin projects by updating the submodule project.
While cloning my main repo, it won't retrieve the submodules or external plugin git
projects. But we have all the settings and paths in my git projects itself.
So we can easily fetch the current stable code from all the external projects.
To do that, type below commands inside your Dotfiles folder.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span><span class="nb">pwd</span>
<span class="go">&lt;path to gitproject&gt;/Dotfiles</span>

<span class="gp">$</span>git submodule init
<span class="gp">$</span>git submodule update
</pre></div>
<p>Now you have all the files required to get start with Vim, Next thing is to
link my git files as your vim files. To do that just create soft link of
the Vim system files and then point it to my git repository files.
Here is the steps.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span><span class="nb">cd</span>
<span class="gp">$</span>ln -s &lt;path-to&gt;Dotfiles/vim-files/vim .vim
<span class="gp">$</span>ln -s &lt;path-to&gt;Dotfiles/vim-files/vim/vimrc .vimrc
</pre></div>
<p>Thats it, now open your vim, you can see all the features described above are
being available, except command-t. Because it requires a compilation.
The compilation step is very simple. Follow me,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> &lt;path-to&gt;Dotfiles/vim-files/vim/bundle/command-t/ruby/command-t
<span class="gp">$</span> ruby extconf.rb
<span class="gp">$</span> make
</pre></div>
<p>The make will succeed only when you have gcc installed ,
and your Vim has ruby support. To check the ruby support, open your vim and type,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">:</span><span class="k">ruby</span> <span class="m">1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If there is no error then you have ruby support with your vim.
The latest version of Vim has support for major
dynamic languages like Python, Ruby and others. So that it won't give you any
head ache.</p>
<p>If the dynamic language support is not there with your Vim, then you have to
install complete vim from your package manager.</p>
<p>If you are using Debian based system you can follow this command. Other
platforms has also the same option using their package manager tool.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span>apt-cache search python <span class="p">|</span> grep vim
<span class="gp">$</span>apt-cache search ruby <span class="p">|</span> grep vim
</pre></div>
<p>From the list install any of the GUI based package.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>All these hard works to setup your Vim would be useful to you only when you
realize the fact that the Vim basic editing features will save you a lot of
your time and increase the productivity. For that you don't required above discussed
plugin features. The plugins will only reduce some keystrokes via we will get some
productivity improvements. But it won't turn you from other editors to Vim.
Vim default features are more than enough to attract you to use Vim.
I hope you understood my feeling. :)</p>
<p>Enjoy the Vim hacking.</p>
